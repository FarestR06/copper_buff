Satisying r/PhoenixSC's [progression-related demands](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixSC/comments/1lqprt6/my_issue_with_coppers_uselessness) using vanilla data packs!
## Features
***PLEASE NOTE:*** *Copper equipment taken from the Creative inventory do not have buffed data components. Admins should use the functions to obtain buffed equipment.*
### Better Durability
Copper Tools now have extra durability, so they should last a little longer.
### Better for Mining
By replacing vanilla tags, your copper tools can finally mine diamonds!
### Tougher Armor
The armor is weak, so I gave each piece one point of toughness!
